## Problem Statement
Deskify currently relies on Excel to compile, analyze, and report its monthly sales and transaction data. However, this process has become increasingly cumbersome and time-consuming due to the complexity of the data and the high volume of transactions processed each month. The reporting process involves manual data entry and consolidation from multiple sources, which introduces errors and inconsistencies.
